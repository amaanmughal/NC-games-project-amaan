NC-games project notes

Two additional files will need to be created in order to gain access to the necessary environment variables.

You will firstly need to add a .env.development file with the following code ( PGDATABASE=nc_games ) in order to access the developer database.

next you will need to add a .env.test file with the following code ( PGDATABASE=nc_games_test ) in order to access the test database.
